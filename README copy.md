General Design Notes:

The background is a very light grey/off-white.

Text is dark grey/black for headings and main content, with blue used for links and accents.

Cards and sections have subtle rounded corners and soft shadows, giving a slightly lifted appearance.

Icons are simple, monochromatic, and align with the content.

The overall layout is responsive, with sections stacking vertically.
